# Tools for integrated circuit design

This is a collection of small integrated circuit design scripts.

## Usage

Many of the tools are based on magic and klayout, so make sure they are
included in your path if you want to run them. 

Also export a environment variable called IC_TOOLS that points
to this repository.

For example if you're in the ic_tools repository: 

```
export IC_TOOLS="$(pwd)"
```
